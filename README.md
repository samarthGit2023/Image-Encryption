# Image-Encryption

The Image Encryption project offers a practical solution for encrypting digital images using various algorithms. With different encryption techniques, including the Caesar Cipher, Vigenere Cipher, BitPlaneSlicing-Substitution Algorithm, AES Encryption and Modular Arithmetic techniques we can ensure the privacy and security of your valuable image data.

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook file, making it easy to understand and modify the code according to needs. We simply select the desired algorithm, provide our input image, and execute the code to generate an encrypted version of the image. Additionally, the project provides a visual comparison feature that allows you to assess the impact of each encryption algorithm on the original image, helping us make informed decisions about the trade-offs between security and visual quality.
